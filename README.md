# check-name
Simplest, cheapest and easiest API to check if there is a correct first name in a string

![Gif: Say my name](/docs/images/myname.gif)

# Introduction

If you are creating chatbots probably you have already asked the name of some user. For instance:

```md
Bot: Hi there, what is your name?  
User: Rafael Pacheco  
Bot: Welcome, Rafael Pacheco. I'm very happy to talk with you.  

Result: üòÄüëç
```

Note that in this sample the Bot use the user input believing that it's a real and valid name.
However, if the user sends something different than a name the result can be terrible, as shown below:

```md
Bot: Hi there, what is your name?  
User: go F#%K yourself  
Bot: Welcome, go F#%K yourself. I'm very happy to talk with you.  

Result: üòîüëé
```

This API was built in order to verify if there are correct first names in a string.

By the way, this project is based on:

* **PT-BR** - the last [Brazillian Censo](https://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/) (2010), there are more than 130,000 different first names of people in Brazil. 
The [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/) is the government institute responsible for this research. [Click here](https://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/nomes) if you want to get all the research database.

* **EN-US** - National Data on the relative frequency of given names in the population of U.S. births where the individual has a Social Security Number. Tabulated based on [Social Security records](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data) as of March 4, 2018.

**Note:** This API should work for a huge number of names. However, if by some reason it doesn't work properly please submit the name using this endpoint.
